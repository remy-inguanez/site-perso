	<p>As the incoming IT Director of Queen's Startup Summit, one of my tasks is to maintain the current website that we have running and revamp/redesign the website. Within this case study, we will going through my thought process on how I designed and developed the incoming webpage with the overall goal to attract more visitors and potential sponsors to the website.</p>

	</div>
	<p>A few things are wrong with this website:
	<ul>
		<li><div class="center"><img id="portImg" src="../img/portfolio/qssdark.png"><p id="caption">Old landing page</p></div></li>
		<li>1. When I glaced at the website, the landing page was way too dark and right away it lost my attention to scroll down any further.</li>
		<li><div class="center"><img id="portImg" class="imgSpace" src="../img/portfolio/qssdark2.png"></div></li>
		<li>2. It is not optimized for all screen resolution. We are in the age where webpages are responsive and optimized for viewing on any device whether it is on mobile, tablet or a laptop.</li>
		<li>3. A few webpages look very busy, which takes away from any design the webpage I am viewing has.</li>
	</ul>
	</p>
	<div class="center">
		<p><span id='problem'>How are we going to improve the website?</span></p>
		<img id="portImg" src="../img/portfolio/qsscolour.png"><p id="caption">Colour Scheme</p><img id="portImg" src="../img/portfolio/qssfont.png"><p id="caption">Font &amp; Text Colour</p>
	</div>
		<p>Using the colour theory and the psychological meaning behind the chosen colours, the first thing I am going to do is to change the colour scheme of the landing page from a black/brown background to a bright and colourful background. The colour scheme I am running with is white, blue and green, because white makes the website a lot lighter and easy-going on the eyes, while blue means trustworthiness and it is one of the most common colours on a business attire, and green to give a refreshing and balance look. As we are still a new organization entering its fourth year and expanding, a lighter colour scheme will greatly help attract more visitors and potential sponsors to our website.</p>
		<p>For the webpages that looked busy, I will be removing some of the unimportant details in order to keep it up with the design flow I envisioned.</p>
