	<p>Created an application portal for Queen's Startup Summit in order to improve the efficiency of the delegation process. Before I created the portal, the previous delegate teams view all application through a spreadsheet. This increases the time to view an applicant's application especially when going over 100 applications. I have also included additional functionalities that will greatly benefit the delegation team by allowing them to work more efficiently like having real-time search and limiting the amount of applications view per page that would decrease the viewing time per applicant.</p>
	<p>This is my first time building an application portal and implementing the MEAN stack. If I have to start all over again, I would definitely would like to implement it using Angular 2.0 instead of Angular 1.0.</p>
