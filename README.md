##What's New in V2
My new personal webpage using Jekyll, HTML, CSS, MaterializeCSS and jQuery. Compared to the previous one, this webpage is more sleek and highlights my skills and projects better. In addition, it is more optimized and loads a lot faster than the previous webpage (raymondchung.ca).

I am not using the Bootstrap framework but instead MaterializeCSS, because it is based on Google's Material Design and it is more UX/UI opinionated. I am also using Jekyll in order to reduce repetitive code and loading time.
